# Game Logic

## Levels
The game will initially have only one leve (difficulty): 0.

## Board Size
The board size for level:0 is equal to 8 rows of 8 columns (8x8).

## Amount of Boats per Player
The amount of boats is calculated at 20% of the total number of tiles of the board  (8x8=64 * 20% = 13)

## Rules
1. Players will be required to position their boats on their own boards before starting the game. They must assign all their boats.
2. Both players will need to assign their boats on their boards and click "Ready" to start the game or assign them randomly.
