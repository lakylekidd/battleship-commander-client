# Battleship Commander
This project is an assignment of a turn-based game we need to design within a week by [Pedro Abel Díaz Sánchez](https://github.com/coderHook) and [Billy Vlachos](http://github.com/lakylekidd).

## Description
Battleship commander is guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleshipts) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

## Technologies Used
For this project we will be using the following technologies:
* PostgreSQL
* React - Redux
* Javascript
